## 1. Install packages and import dataset

We are going to use the dataset `Carseats` in the package `ISLR` and various tree-fitting functions in `tree`. `Carseats` is a  simulated data set containing sales of child car seats at 400 different stores on 11 features. The features include: `Sales`, `CompPrice`, `Income`, `Advertising`, `Population`, `Price`, `ShelveLoc`, `Age`, `Education`, `Urban` and `US`. Among all the variables, `ShelveLoc`, `Urban` and `US` are categorical and the rest are continuous. 

Notice that originally `Sales` is a continuous variable. Now we create a new  binary variable `High` using `Sales`:

\[
    \text{High}= 
\begin{dcases}
    \text{No},& \text{if Sales} \leq \text{median(Sales)}\\       
    \text{Yes}, & \text{if Sales}  > \text{median(Sales)}
\end{dcases}
\]


Our goal is to investigate how other features (`CompPrice`, `Income`, `Advertising`, `Population`, `Price`, `ShelveLoc`, `Age`, `Education`, `Urban` and `US`)  influence whether the unit sales at each location is high or not. In other words, we look for the relationship between the binary response `High` and all variables but `Sales`.

Using the following codes, the data can be read into R:
```{r pkg, message=F, warning=F, results='hide'}

##install.packages("ISLR")
##install.packages("tree")
##install.packages('maptree')

# Load libraries
library(ISLR) 
library(tree)
library(maptree)

# Utility library
library(dplyr)

# See description of data
# ?Carseats 
```


Using `mutate()` and `ifelse()` to create the binary response variable `High`, then check the structure of resulting data frame with the following codes:

```{r}
# Create data frame with the oringinal eleven variables and High 
Carseats = Carseats %>% 
    mutate(High=as.factor(ifelse(Sales <= median(Sales), "No", "Yes")))

# Check the structure of above data frame we just created
glimpse(Carseats)
```

## 2. A decision tree trained with the entire dataset

Based on the data frame `Carseats` with `High`, we will build a classification tree model, in which `High` will be the response (dependent variable), and the rest 10 features, excluding `Sales`, will be the explanatory variables (independent variables). The classification tree model can be built with function `tree()` in the package `tree`. (Yeah, they share the same name! :])

### Fit, summarize and Visualize the tree

- **`tree()`** can be used to fit both classification and regression tree models. A regression tree is very similar to a classification tree, except that it is used to predict a quantitative response rather than a qualitative one. In this lab, we will focus on classification trees. We put the response variable on the left of tilde, explanatory variables on the right of tilde; the dot is merely an economical way to represent "everything else but High".[^1]

```{r tree, message=F, warning=F, indent=indent1}
tree.carseats = tree(High ~.-Sales, data = Carseats)
```

- **`summary()`** is a generic function used to produce result summaries of various model fitting functions. When we call the `summary` of a tree, we will have the following reported:

    * _Classification tree_: displays the model and the dataset
    * _Variables ... construction_: variables that are truly useful to construct the tree 
    * _Number ... nodes_: the number of leaf node, which is a node that has no child nodes. Let's denote this quantity as $T_0$ for further reference
    * _Residual mean deviance_: is simply the deviance divided by $n-T_0$, which in this case is $400-23 = 377$
    * _Misclassification error rate_: is the number of wrong predictions divided by the number of total predictions
  
      
```{r sumary, indent=indent1}
summary(tree.carseats)
```
R displays the split criterion, the number of observations in that branch, the deviance, the overall prediction for the branch (Yes or No), and the fraction of observations in that branch that take on values of Yes and No. Branches that lead to terminal nodes are indicated using asterisks.

- **`draw.tree()`** in the `maptree` package is helpful for visualizing the structure

```{r pic1, indent=indent1}
draw.tree(tree.carseats, nodeinfo=FALSE)
draw.tree(prune.tree(tree.carseats, best=10), nodeinfo=TRUE)
title("Classification Tree")

# plot(tree.carseats)
# text(tree.carseats, pretty = 0, cex = .8, col = "red")
```

## 3. A decision tree trained with training/test split 

In order to properly evaluate the performance of a classification tree, we should estimate the **test error rate** rather than simply compute the training error rate. Therefore we split all observations into a **training set** and a **test set**, build the tree using the training set, and evaluate the model's performance on the test set. 

### (a). Split the data into a training set and a test set

We sample 75% of observations as the training set and the rest 25% as the test set.

```{r sep}
# Set random seed for results being reproducible
set.seed(3)  
# Get dimension of dataset
dim(Carseats) 
# Sample 75% of observations as the training set
train = sample(1:nrow(Carseats), 0.75*dim(Carseats)[1]) 
# The rest 25% as the test set 
Carseats.test = Carseats[-train,]  

# For later convenience in coding, we create High.test, which is the true labels of the 
# test cases
High.test = Carseats.test$High
```



### (b). Fit the tree on training set and compute test error rate

- **`tree()`** can be used to grow the tree as we discussed in the previous section.
- **`predict()`** is helpful to predict the response (`High`) on the test set. In the case of a classification tree, specifying `type="class"` instructs R to return the actual class predictions instead of probabilities.

    As discussed earlier, we build the model on the training set and predict the labels for `High` on the test set:
    
```{r test, indent=indent1}
# Fit model on training set
tree.carseats = tree(High~.-Sales, data = Carseats, subset = train) 

# Plot the tree

draw.tree(tree.carseats, nodeinfo=TRUE)
title("Classification Tree Built on Training Set")
# plot(tree.carseats)
# text(tree.carseats, pretty = 0, cex = .8, col = "red")
# title("Classification Tree Built on Training Set")

# Predict on test set
tree.pred = predict(tree.carseats, Carseats.test, type="class") 
tree.pred
```

- To calculate the test error rate, we can construct a confusion matrix and use the counter diagonal sum divided by the total counts.
    
```{r conf, indent=indent1}
# Obtain confusion matrix
error = table(tree.pred, High.test)
error
# Test accuracy rate
sum(diag(error))/sum(error)
# Test error rate (Classification Error)
1-sum(diag(error))/sum(error)
```

    This approach leads to correct predictions for
`r 100*sum(diag(error))/sum(error)`% of the locations in the test set. In
other words, the test error rate is `r 100*(1-sum(diag(error))/sum(error))`%.


## 4. Prune the tree using `prune.tree()`/`cv.tree()` and `prune.misclass()`

Next, we consider whether pruning the tree might lead to a lower test error. To do so, primarily we have to decide what the best size of the tree should be, then we can trim the tree to this pre-determined size. 

### (a). Determine the best size 

By 'best' size, for example, if we use classification error rate to guide the pruning process, we mean the number of terminal nodes which corresponds to the **smallest** classification error. There are other goodness-of-fit measures available, such as deviance, the 'best' size in this case is the number of leaf nodes which gives the smallest deviance. We have two ways to determine the best size of the tree: either use **`prune.tree()`** or **`cv.tree()`**, which are both from package `tree`.

- **`prune.tree()`** does a cost-complexity pruning of a tree object. The argument `method` is the scoring measure used to trim the tree. The argument `k` is user-specified cost-complexity parameter, and `best` instructs R to return a tree exactly of this size. Larger the cost-complexity `k`, smaller the tree, although cost-complexity `k` does not correspond to tree size in any exact way. (`k` is similar to parameter $\alpha$ in equation 8.4 in ISLR). `prune.tree()` yields several results such as sizes of the trees, complexity parameters and guiding method of the pruning. 

```{r, indent=indent1}
prune = prune.tree(tree.carseats, k = 0:20, method = "misclass")
# Best size
best.prune = prune$size[which.min(prune$dev)]
best.prune
```

    Note: we specified misclassification error as the scoring method, so `$dev` is not deviance but actually misclassification error. Also, we didn't specified `newdata` option in `prune.tree`, so `$dev` is computed on the training data. From the output, the 'best' size is `r best.prune` since this number of terminal nodes corresponds to the smallest misclassification error.
    

- **`cv.tree()`** performs k-fold Cross-validation in order to determine the optimal level of tree complexity; cost-complexity pruning is used in order to select a sequence of trees for consideration. The argument `FUN=prune.misclass` is to indicate that misclassification error should guide the Cross-validation and pruning process, rather than the default deviance in the `cv.tree()` function. `K=10` instructs R to use a 10-fold Cross-validation in order to find the best size. The `cv.tree()` function reports the number of terminal nodes of each tree considered, as well as the corresponding error rate and the value of the cost-complexity parameter `k` used.

```{r prune, indent=indent1}
# Set random seed
set.seed(3) 

# K-Fold cross validation
cv = cv.tree(tree.carseats, FUN=prune.misclass, K=10)
# Print out cv
cv

# Best size 
best.cv = cv$size[which.min(cv$dev)]
best.cv

# Get names of entries in cv
names(cv)
# Get classes in cv, produce the same result 
class(cv)
```

    Note again, despite the name, `$dev` is the Cross-validation error instead of deviance. The tree with `r best.cv` terminal nodes results in the lowest error.


### (b). Error vs. Best Size plot and Error vs. Complexity plot

- On the basis of `prune.tree()` result:

```{r, indent=indent1, echo=F, fig.height=3.7}
# Change graphic layout
op = par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# Plot size vs. cross-validation error rate
plot(prune$size , prune$dev, type="b", 
     xlab = "Number of leaves, \'best\'", ylab = "Misclassification Error",
     col = "red", main="Prune")
abline(v=best.prune, lty=2)
# Plot the optimal k vs. cross-validation error rate
plot(prune$k, prune$dev, type = "b",
     xlab = "Complexity Parameter, \'k\'", ylab = "Misclassification Error",
     col = "blue", main="Prune")
# Add lines to identify complexity parameter
min.error = which.min(prune$dev) # Get minimum error index
abline(h = prune$dev[min.error],lty = 2)
abline(v = prune$k[min.error],lty = 2)
```

- Based on `cv.tree()` result:

```{r, indent=indent1, echo=F, fig.height=3.5}
# Change graphic layout
op = par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# Plot size vs. cross-validation error rate
plot(cv$size , cv$dev, type="b", 
     xlab = "Number of leaves, \'best\'", ylab = "CV Misclassification Error",
     col = "red", main="CV")
abline(v=best.cv, lty=2)
# Plot the optimal k vs. cross-validation error rate
plot(cv$k, cv$dev, type = "b",
     xlab = "Complexity Parameter, \'k\'", ylab = "CV Misclassification Error",
     col = "blue", main="CV")
# Add lines to identify complexity parameter
min.error = which.min(cv$dev) # Get minimum error index
abline(h = cv$dev[min.error],lty = 2)
abline(v = cv$k[min.error],lty = 2)
```

### (c) Prune the tree and visualize it

- **`prune.misclass`** is used to prune a tree in order to have a tree with targeted best number of terminal nodes.

    First, let's "trim" the original tree, `tree.carseats`, to have `r best.prune` nodes. (`r best.prune` was determined from `prune.tree()`.)
    
```{r, indent=indent1}
# Prune tree.carseats
pt.prune = prune.misclass (tree.carseats, best=best.prune)

# Plot pruned tree
plot(pt.prune)
text(pt.prune, pretty=0, col = "red", cex = .8)
title("Pruned tree of size 25")
```


    Second, let's trim `tree.carseats` to have `r best.cv` nodes. This number was determined by `cv.tree()`.

```{r, indent=indent1}
# Prune tree.carseats
pt.cv = prune.misclass (tree.carseats, best=best.cv)

# Plot pruned tree
plot(pt.cv)
text(pt.cv, pretty=0, col = "blue", cex = .8)
title("Pruned tree of size 11")
```

### (d) Calculate respective test error rate for model `pt.prune` and `pt.cv`

Recall that in (3b), we built `tree.carseats` on the training set and obtained the test error rate as 21%. In (4a) and (4c), we trimmed the tree in two ways and got two tree models: `pt.prune` and `pt.cv`, thus we want to see if the two trimmed tree are better than `tree.carseats`, judged by the test misclassification error rate. Let's predict the labels for `High` on test set for two models and construct confusion matrices.

- Tree `pt.prune`

```{r conf1, indent=indent1}
# Predict on test set
pred.pt.prune = predict(pt.prune, Carseats.test, type="class") 
# Obtain confusion matrix
err.pt.prune = table(pred.pt.prune, High.test)
err.pt.prune
# Test accuracy rate
sum(diag(err.pt.prune))/sum(err.pt.prune)
# Test error rate (Classification Error)
1-sum(diag(err.pt.prune))/sum(err.pt.prune)
```

    The test error rate for `pt.prune` is `r 1-sum(diag(err.pt.prune))/sum(err.pt.prune)`, which is the same as the result in (3b). This is not surprising because `pt.prune` is exactly the same as `tree.carseats`. To verify it, you can compare the two trees visually or notice that the number of terminal nodes in `pt.prune` and `tree.carseats` are both $25$, indicating the trees grown are identical.
    
- Tree `pt.cv`

```{r conf2, indent=indent1}
# Predict on test set
pred.pt.cv = predict(pt.cv, Carseats.test, type="class") 
# Obtain confusion matrix
err.pt.cv = table(pred.pt.cv, High.test)
err.pt.cv
# Test accuracy rate
sum(diag(err.pt.cv))/sum(err.pt.cv)
# Test error rate (Classification Error)
1-sum(diag(err.pt.cv))/sum(err.pt.cv)
```

    The test error rate for `pt.cv` is `r 1-sum(diag(err.pt.cv))/sum(err.pt.cv)`, which is really close to the result in (3a). Since this tree is simpler (as shown in 4c) without much loss of accuracy, therefore we think `pt.cv` is the best among all trees we grew.

## Your turn

Using the original tree `tree.carseats`, perform 5-fold Cross-validation to determine the best size of the tree:
```{r}
# Codes start here

```

Calculate the test error rate:
```{r}
# Codes start here:

# Test set is Carseats.test

```
